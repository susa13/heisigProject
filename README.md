# heisigProject  
simple flash card randomizer/study tool  
"heisig.txt" and "kanji.txt" should be in the same directory as heisigProject.  
It follows the order of keyword to text file line number so keep that in mind.  
kanji.txt follows the fourth edition of "Heisig's Remembering the Kanji" unfortunately since that's what I started with.  

If you want to use the 6th edition, I don't have the english word text file so feel free to make your own! I'll start it up in case anyone else wants to continue appending to it while studying.  
There is the kanji6.txt file that contains all of the 6th edition however, formatted from https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1a126a/all_2200_kanji_from_heisigs_remembering_the_kanji/  
Be sure to rename the "kanji6.txt" file to "kanji.txt" or the "heisig6.txt" to "heisig.txt"  
I added numbers to my kanji.txt to make it easier to keep track of when adding to the text file, but I think my code handles if you only put the kanji.  
日本語の勉強でがんばって！
